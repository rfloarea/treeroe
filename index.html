        Hey! You found me! Welcome my treehouse-treesite-webtree-page!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        By way of introduction, here's an evolving list of things I like that you didn't ask for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Trees (I know, right? Who saw that coming?).
        </li>
        <li>
            Drumming on any hard surface.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tiny spoons.
        </li>
        <li>
            Making coffee for myself and others.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stocking the free community fridge with zuchinni and cucumbers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Doodling with black ink pens.
        </li>
        <li>
            Playing my partner's guitar on my in-law's back porch.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reading from random pages in books.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sharp, well made knives. They're just so pretty.
        </li>
        <li>
            Vacuuming. Live it. Learn it. Love it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Words. I like 'em.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blueberries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pitbulls.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        Now that you know more about me than I know about myself, here's more stuff! Hooray stuff!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        As it happens, I enjoy sharing stuff I make as much as I enjoy making the stuff. If that also sounds fun to you, check out my 
        <a href="https://github.com/rfloarea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> for some code flavored stuff.
    </p>

    <p>
        But just in case you didn't click that link, (tangent: I went to high school with a kid named Justin Case...Justin, if you can hear this, I hope you're well.) here's one project that makes me smile: <a href="write_bad_code/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WRITE BAD CODE</a>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I'm always working on <em>something</em>, so this list will change. Actually, my most recent project is a series of back-to-basics web development. My goal is to make a bazillion simple projects using no frameworks or build steps or bundling. Just HTML, CSS, and JavaMamaScript. I'll write up a little something about each one as I go.

    <p>Hey! You found me! Welcome my treehouse treesite webtree thing! (the name is a work in progress)</p>
    <p>By way of introduction, here's an evolving list of things I like and that you didn't ask for!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trees (I know, right? Who saw that coming?)</li>
        <li>Drumming on any hard surface.</li>
        <li>Tiny spoons.</li>
        <li>Doodling with black ink pens.</li>
        <li>Reading from random pages in books.</li>
        <li>Sharp, well made knives. They're just so pretty.</li>
        <li>Vacuuming. Live it. Learn it. Love it.</li>
        <li>Words.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Speaking of words, I'm planning to use this treespace (better? worse?) to share words! But I'm sure I'll want to share other stuff too. Maybe photos? Maybe audio? Maybe even...other stuff.</p>
    <p>You can find me at <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treeroe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@treeroe</a> but I'm still not sure how to exist there. It would be better to just email me at hi@treeroe.me</p>

    <h2>Questions from the Audience</h2>
    <h3>How is this site made?</h3>
    <p>Thanks for asking! It's super simple:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Registered my domain name through Porkbun</li>
        <li>Static hosting through Porkbun</li>
        <li>Used Porkbun's feature that syncs to a GitHub repo</li>
        <li>Created a GitHub repo for this site and clicked some buttons to connect them</li>
        <li>And then, ya know, typed this stuff</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>There's basically nothing here. What should I expect as a paying customer?</h3>
    <p>Well first of all, thank you for your support. None of this would be possible without you.</p>
    <p>And second of all, you can expect really horrible, gruesome, and unpleasant experiences. Like Game of Thrones meets Terrifier 2. Just kidding! This is clearly just a vanity project with no intention of providing meaningful content to mindful audiences. But doesn't that sound better by comparison?! Sign me up!</p>
    <p>And third of all, you get what you pay for. Which is nothing. You get nothing.</p>
    <h3>Why does this website look like...</h3>
    <p>Like crap? Yeah, well, here's the thing, the big reveal, the big AL AKAZAAM! I like it.</p>
    <h3>Is it okay if I hate this?</h3>
    <p>Yup! In fact, it's encouraged! Hooray democracy!!!!11!!1 (is that how it works, not sure...)</p>

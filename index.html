    <h2>
        Hey there,
    </h2>

    <p>
        Looks like you found my treesite-webhouse-netpage thing.
    </p>

    <P>
        It's rather sparse in here, I know. But I guess now you can take the time you would have used to engage with
        Very Good Content
        to just breath or something.
    </P>

    <p>
        I dunno.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hope to have some tasty offerings here eventually. What exactly? I'm not sure.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, I do know that you can send your robo-pigeons to
        <a href="mailto:hi@treeroe.me">hi@treeroe.me</a> if you want to talk about stuff. I'm happy to chat about any
        ol' thing.
    </p>

    <p>
        ttfn,
    </p>

            little things</a> I've coded.

    <p>Hey there. It's me. roe. This is my treehouse. Treesite? Webtree? I dunno.</p>
    <p>Let's just imagine some very suitable metaphor analogy type thing, having to do with trees and websites.</p>
    <p>By way of introduction (as is the custom of personal websites), here is an evolving list of things I like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trees (I know, right? Who saw that coming?)</li>
        <li>Drumming on any hard surface.</li>
        <li>Tiny spoons.</li>
        <li>Doodling with black ink pens.</li>
        <li>Reading from random pages in a book.</li>
        <li>Sharp, well made knives. They just get me.</li>
        <li>Vacuuming. Live it. Learn it. Love it.</li>
        <li>Words.</li>
    </ul>

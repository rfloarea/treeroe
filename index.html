    <p>Hey! You found me! Welcome my treehouse-treesite-webtree-page!</p>
    <br>
    <p>By way of introduction, here's an evolving list of things I like that you didn't ask for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trees (I know, right? Who saw that coming?)</li>
        <li>Drumming on any hard surface.</li>
        <li>Tiny spoons.</li>
        <li>Making coffee for myself and others.</li>
        <li>Doodling with black ink pens.</li>
        <li>Playing my partner's guitar on my in-law's back porch.</li>
        <li>Reading from random pages in books.</li>
        <li>Sharp, well made knives. They're just so pretty.</li>
        <li>Vacuuming. Live it. Learn it. Love it.</li>
        <li>Words. I like 'em.</li>
        <li>Blueberries.</li>
        <li>Pitbulls.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Now that you know more about me than I know about myself, here's more stuff! Hooray stuff!</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can find me in the Wild Wild Web as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@treeroe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@treeroe</a> (mastodon).</p>
    <p>But if electronic email is more your style, send your robo-pigeons to <a href="mailto:hi@treeroe.me" >hi@treeroe.me</a> (I really do love getting email)</p>
    <br>
    <p>Oh! One more thing! (dam, I'm on fire today :D)</p>
    <p>As it so happens, I enjoy sharing almost as much as I enjoy coding. If that also sounds fun to you, check out my <a href="https://github.com/rfloarea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>But just in case you didn't click that link, (side note: I went to high school with a kid named Justin Case...Justin, if you can hear this, I hope you're well.) here are a few projects that make me smile:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="write_bad_code/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WRITE BAD CODE</a> - the caps lock is intentional</li>
        <li>(obligatory) <a href="https://rfloarea.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rock, paper, scissors</a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://rfloarea.github.io/tic-tac-toe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tic Tac Toe</a>  (also obligatory)</li>
        <li><a href="https://rfloarea.github.io/todo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TODO</a>(you get the idea)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>I'm always working on <em>something</em>, so this list will change. Actually, if you want, my most recent focus is building a web app version of a simple Leitner Box to study Romanian.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All about Leitner Systems</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://ncase.me/remember/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How I learned about it</a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/rfloarea/leitner-box" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My code so far</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>But the biggest news on the block is that I've finally made sense of a personal knowledge management system (digital note taking). I'm still cooking it, but I'll share it when it's ready!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ta ta for now!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Take care,</p>
    <p>~ roe</p>
